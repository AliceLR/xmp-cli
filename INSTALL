Requirements
------------

- This package needs the GNU make. In BSD or SysV you may need to use
  gmake instead of make.

- Development components of the sound system to use (ALSA, Pulse Audio, etc.)
  are required to build sound drivers. Most Linux distributions provide
  these as -devel or -dev packages.

- Development components of libxmp 4.0.0 or later. Libxmp is available at
  http://xmp.sf.net.


Building xmp
------------

In most systems just execute:

$ ./configure
$ make

Use ./configure --with-libxmp=/some/path if libxmp is installed in a
nonstandard place.

To build on Cygwin you may need to pass --with-libxmp=/usr/local.


Installation
------------

The xmp binary doesn't need a special installation procedure to run,
you can just copy src/xmp to an appropriate place. To install all
components run:

# make install

as the superuser. This will install the xmp executable and man page into
directories under /usr/local or a different location selected with the
--prefix option in configure.
